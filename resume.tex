\section{Experience}
\cventry{2011--2013}{Business Infrastructure Engineer}{Kontagent}{Toronto, ON}{}{
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Developed modular infrastructure to process metrics definitions and customer usage metadata from core analytics SaaS product.
  \item Distributed above analyses to customer relations, customer support, and documentation teams for data-driven analysis.
  \item Derived technical/process deliverables though collaborating over requirements and usage scenarios with non-technical end users.
  \item Bootstrapped and developed best practices for Django-based projects using Vagrant for local virtualization and Puppet for seamless deployment.
  \item Mentored undergraduate co-ops and interns in both software and documentation development.
  \item In order to advertise team bandwidth and clarify intended roadmap, moved team onto a combination of Kanban and Scrum-driven project planning.
  \item Conducted post-mortems on department's previous failed initiatives, restarting them while accounting for factors in previous failures.
  \item Engaged local developer community in order to attract talent and increase Kontagent's presence in community.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Modernized a custom and long-lived C++-based embedded operating system designed for enterprise network infrastructure.
  \item Ported libpcre (a popular regular expression library), adapting for our system's particular memory and multiprocessing requirements.
  \item Extended a boost-inspired standard library for a proprietary embedded operating system.
  \item Restructured monolithic and inadequately-tested components into well-tested modular designs without breaking customer or QA expectations.
  \item Adopted --- organically and through retrospection --- scrum and test-driven methodologies for a team with a variety of experience and enthusiasm.
  \end{itemize}

    \item application-specific protocol optimization.
    \item configuration language parsing and compilation.
    \item interprocess communication primitives and concurrency mechanism.
    \item core kernel routines.
    \item a log-based filesystem.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Utilized custom-generated configuration files, memory dumps, annotated assembly code, and GDB on optimized code to troubleshoot crashes in the field.
  \item Trended internal crash statistics to proactively anticipate possible issues in the field.
  \item Developed custom continuous integration system to poll an externally controlled source repository server for new project revisions for testing and report-generation.
  \end{itemize}}
